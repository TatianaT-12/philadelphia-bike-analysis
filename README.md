# Indego Bike Share Analysis – Philadelphia (Q1 2021)

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of Indego bike share trips in Philadelphia during the first quarter of 2021. The project focuses on cleaning and analyzing trip-level data to better understand rider behavior and usage patterns.

## Project Overview
Using R, I analyzed bike share trips to explore:
- Daily ride trends by trip route category (one-way vs. round-trip)
- Trips with durations greater than 60 minutes
- The top 10 most frequently used bikes in Q1 2021

The goal of this project is to demonstrate data cleaning, transformation, and visualization skills commonly used in business analytics.

## Data
The dataset includes trip duration, start time, start location, bike ID, and trip route category.
